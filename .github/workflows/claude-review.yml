            Perform a comprehensive code review with the following focus areas:

            1. **Security**
               - IAM role bindings follow least-privilege principle
               - Secrets are never hardcoded; use Pulumi ESC or Secret Manager
               - Network policies and firewall rules are appropriately restrictive
               - GKE workload identity is used instead of service account keys

            2. **Infrastructure Correctness**
               - Pulumi resource configuration is valid and idiomatic
               - Resource naming follows kebab-case with environment prefix
               - Dependencies between resources are explicitly declared

            3. **Cost & Reliability**
               - Resources are appropriately sized for the target environment
               - Autopilot/managed services are preferred over manual configuration

            4. **GitOps Consistency**
               - ArgoCD Application definitions reference the correct repo/path/revision
               - Kustomize overlays apply patches to the correct base resources

            Provide detailed feedback using inline comments for specific issues.
            Use top-level comments for general observations or praise.
