While the `design.md` mentions \"Use Commit SHA as tag\" as a mitigation, it's crucial to ensure the CI/CD pipeline or a Kustomize overlay dynamically updates this tag to a unique, immutable identifier (e.g., commit SHA) before deployment, especially for environments beyond development.\n\n```suggestion\n          image: asia-northeast2-docker.pkg.dev/liverty-music-dev/backend/server:main # Placeholder.
